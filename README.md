## General Info
`Chess | Mini Python-Project` is a Python-based mini-project implemented in the terminal. It provides a complete chess-playing experience using algebraic notation for moves, move validation, and saving the game's history in PGN format after the game.

Inspired by my love for chess, I created this project to offer an engaging and educational experience. The game leverages the `python-chess` library to handle complex chess logic, including legal moves, board representation, and special scenarios like castling and pawn promotion.
